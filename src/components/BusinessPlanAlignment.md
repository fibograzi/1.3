  | 1,500,000 - 4,999,999 | 4× |
  | 5,000,000 - 24,999,999 | 5× |
  | ≥ 25,000,000 | 8× |
  
  - Website needs interactive calculator to demonstrate this system

### 5. NFT System
- "Meme-characters" NFTs that unlock in-game abilities
- NFT utility: bonuses like double speed, extra points, etc.

- Website needs NFT showcase and explanation of utility

### 6. Lootwheel Implementation
- Interactive prize wheel (Winwheel.js or Unity asset)
- Random drops based on weights (LootTable.js)
- Website needs interactive lootwheel demonstration

### 7. Tokenomics (1 billion supply)
- **Distribution**:
  - Public launch (Pump.fun): 25% (250,000,000)
  - Liquidity/bonding (PumpSwap): 20% (200,000,000)
  - Community/airdrop/staking: 20% (200,000,000)
  - Team & founders (with vesting): 10% (100,000,000)
  - Marketing & partners: 10% (100,000,000)
  - Development/reserve: 10% (100,000,000)
  - Advisors/bounties: 5% (50,000,000)
  - Website needs visual representation of this distribution

### 8. Launch Strategy
- Platform: Pump.fun (Solana meme-coin platform)
- Trading: PumpSwap
- Website needs to explain the launch process and provide links

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed:
- Project structure established
- Core dependencies installed (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Three.js, GSAP, Solana Web3.js)
- Cyberpunk styling foundation created with neon purple/green theme
- Custom UI components designed (buttons, cards, headings)

### Next Steps Based on Business Plan:
1. Create website layout with cyberpunk theme
2. Implement responsive navigation with wallet connection
3. Build homepage with game showcase
4. Develop tokenomics visualization
5. Create interactive lootwheel demonstration
6. Build NFT showcase section
7. Implement token calculator based on multiplier system
8. Ensure all social links (Telegram, Twitter) are correctly integrated

## Alignment Validation
- The current styling and theme directly align with the neon/cyberpunk aesthetic described in the business plan
- The project structure supports all required sections identified in the business plan
- The technology stack (React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Three.js, Solana Web3.js) is appropriate for implementing all required features
- The planned components will effectively showcase the game features, token system, and NFT functionality

This document will be updated at each major development milestone to ensure continued alignment with the business plan.
